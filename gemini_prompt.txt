CONTEXT:
The input JSON contains Red Bull product data. The goal is to clean and structure this data while preserving the original product identity. The primary objective is to separate the core edition name from its flavor description. Translation and standardization are applied strategically to ensure consistency and readability.

INSTRUCTIONS:

**1. Global Rules:**
- Analyze the entire input JSON to understand the data structure before processing each item.
- The final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
- The order and original casing of the root country keys (e.g., `germany`, `international`) MUST be preserved.

**2. Per-Product Processing Logic:**
For each product object in the `editions` list, create a new object by applying the following rules in order:

- **`id` (string):**
  - Use the `id` from the input directly. Do not modify.

- **`sugarfree` (boolean):**
  - Initialize as `false`.
  - Analyze the original `name` and `flavour` from the input. If either contains a sugar-free keyword (e.g., 'Sugarfree', 'Zero', 'Zuckerfrei', 'ÁÑ°Á≥ñ', 'ZERO CALORIAS'), set this field to `true`.

- **`flavor_description` (string):**
  - This is a mandatory and unconditional step.
  - Take the `standfirst` text from the input.
  - It MUST ALWAYS be translated into proper, natural-sounding English, regardless of its original language.
  - Preserve Title Case for flavors within the text like "Pink Grapefruit".

- **`flavor` (string):**
  - **Goal:** Create a clean, standardized, English flavor name that respects the original's structure.
  - **Step 1: Translate:** Take the original `flavour` field from the input and translate it to English if it's in another language (e.g., "Ïó¥ÎåÄÍ≥ºÏùºÌñ•" -> "Tropical Fruit", "P√™che blanche" -> "White Peach").
  - **Step 2: Normalize Separators while Preserving Intent:** This is a crucial step. Do NOT automatically convert all separators and spaces.
    - **Rule A:** First, in the translated string, replace any slashes (`/`) with a hyphen (`-`).
    - **Rule B:** If a hyphen (`-`) and the word `and` appear together (e.g., in a string like `word-and-word`), remove the redundant `and`.
    - **Rule C (Crucial):** Do NOT replace natural language like `and` or simple spaces between words with a hyphen. Preserve them.
      - Correct: `"Strawberry and apricot"` -> `"Strawberry and Apricot"`
      - Correct: `"White Peach"` -> `"White Peach"`
      - Incorrect: `"White Peach"` -> `"White-Peach"`
    - **Rule D:** Preserve original hyphens (`-`) and ampersands (`&`) when they are the intended separator.
  - **Step 3: Clean Keywords:** Remove generic, non-taste words (case-insensitive) such as "Flavor", "Flavour", "Taste", "Smag", "With", "sugarfree", "zero", and any lingering punctuation.
  - **Step 4: Mandatory Deduplication:** If the string contains repeated words after standardization, simplify it. A string like "Tropical-Tropical-Fruits" must be simplified to "Tropical-Fruits".
  - **Step 5: Final Formatting:** Apply Title Case to the entire final string (e.g., "dragon fruit" -> "Dragon Fruit", "strawberry and apricot" -> "Strawberry and Apricot"). Trim any leading/trailing whitespace.
  - **Step 6: Fallback:** If after all cleaning the field is empty, use the value "Energy Drink".

- **`name` (string):**
  - **Goal:** The final `name` must contain the edition's core title, with flavor descriptions removed but functional modifiers (like "Sugarfree") preserved.
  - **Step 1: Typo Correction:** First, correct common typos in the original `name`. Specifically, replace any instance of "Ediation" with "Edition".
  - **Step 2: Isolate Core Title:** Analyze the (potentially typo-corrected) name to separate the core product title from descriptive flavor words.
    - **Principle:** The core title represents the product line (often using words like "Edition", "Summer", "Winter", colors, or regional names like "Cereja"), while flavor words are specific tastes to be removed (like "Juneberry", "Watermelon", "White Peach"). Use your semantic understanding to make this distinction.
    - **Example 1:** "The Summer Edition Juneberry" -> Core title is "The Summer Edition".
    - **Example 2:** "The Green Edition Exotic Passion Fruit" -> Core title is "The Green Edition".
    - **Example 3:** "Watermelon" -> This is only a flavor, so the core title is empty.
  - **Step 3: Add "The" to Editions:** If the resulting core title contains the word "Edition" and does not already start with "The ", add it to the beginning. Example: "Winter Edition" -> "The Winter Edition".
  - **Step 4: Handle Generic Names:** If the core title after Step 2 is ONLY "Zero", ONLY "Sugarfree", or is empty, the name becomes "Energy Drink". If the original was "Zero" or "Sugarfree", append that modifier.
    - **Example 1:** "Zero" -> "Energy Drink Zero".
    - **Example 2:** "SugarFree" -> "Energy Drink Sugarfree".
    - **Example 3:** "Watermelon" (which resulted in an empty core title) -> "Energy Drink".
  - **Step 5: Finalize:** The resulting string is the final value for `name`.

**3. Final Output Structure & Cleanup:**
- Each country object must contain a `flag` and a list of `editions`.
- Each product object in `editions` must contain `id`, `name`, `flavor`, `flavor_description`, and `sugarfree`.
- **Flag Conversion Logic:**
  - Country Codes: Convert standard codes to flag emojis (e.g., "US" -> üá∫üá∏, "DE" -> üá©üá™).
  - International: If `flag` is "Worldwide" and the root key is `international`, use the globe emoji üåç.
  - Regions: If `flag` is "Worldwide" and the root key is a region, use a suitable regional emoji ("caribbean" -> üå¥, "middle-east" -> üê™, etc.).
- **Final Text Cleaning:**
  - Before outputting, trim leading/trailing whitespace and remove special characters like `*` or `#` from all final string values.
  - **Mandatory Word Replacement:** In ALL final string values, especially within `flavor_description`, you MUST replace every instance of the word "sugars" with "sugar". This is a non-negotiable final step.

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
Your response must be ONLY the final, clean JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanations, or Markdown formatting.
