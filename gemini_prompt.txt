CONTEXT:
The input JSON contains Red Bull product data. The goal is to clean and structure this data while preserving the original product identity. The primary objective is to separate the core edition name from its flavor description. Translation and standardization are applied strategically to ensure consistency and readability.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Global Rules:
- Analyze the entire input JSON to understand the data structure before processing each item.
- The final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
- The order and original casing of the root country keys (e.g., germany, international) MUST be preserved.

2. Per-Product Processing Logic:
For each product object in the editions list, create a new object by applying the following rules in order:

- id (string):
  - Use the id from the input directly. Do not modify.

- sugarfree (boolean):
  - Initialize as false.
  - Analyze the original name from the input. If it contains a sugar-free keyword (e.g., 'Sugarfree', 'Zero', 'Zuckerfrei', 'ÁÑ°Á≥ñ'), set this field to true.

- name (string):
  - Goal: The final name MUST contain the edition's core title. Remove explicit flavor descriptions (e.g., "White Peach", "Watermelon", "Juneberry"), but **preserve functional modifiers** like "Sugarfree" or "Zero" if they are part of the original name.
  - Step 0: Typo Correction: Before any other processing, correct common typos in the original name. Specifically, replace any instance of "Ediation" with "Edition".
  - Step 1: Handle Non-Latin Scripts: If the original name is in a non-Latin script (e.g., ÁÑ°Á≥ñËÉΩÈáèÈ£≤Êñô), translate the entire string to its clean English equivalent first (e.g., "Sugarfree Energy Drink"). Use this translated string as the base for the next steps.
  - Step 2: Preserve Clean Names: If a name in a Latin script is already clean and contains no flavor text (e.g., "The Cereja Edition"), it MUST be preserved as is.
  - Step 3: Separate Flavor: From the (potentially typo-corrected and translated) name, separate the core edition title from the flavor or Energy Drink description.
    - Example 1: "The Green Edition Exotic Passion Fruit Flavor" -> Core title and name is "The Green Edition".
    - Example 2: "The Summer Edition Juneberry" -> Core title and name is "The Summer Edition".
  - Step 4: Ensure each name contains "Edition" starts with "The ".
    - Example: "Purple Edition" -> "The Purple Edition"
    - Example: "The Green Edition" -> "The Green Edition"
  - Step 5: If the name would be only "Zero" or "Sugarfree", add a "Energy Drink" in front.
    - Example 1: "Zero" -> "Energy Drink Zero"
    - Example 2: "Sugarfree" -> "Energy Drink Sugarfree"
  - Step 6: Finalize: The resulting core title is the final value for name.

- flavor_description (string):
  - This is a mandatory and unconditional step.
  - Take the details.standfirst text from the input.
  - If the text is not in English or non-Latin, translate into proper, natural-sounding English.
  - It MUST ALWAYS be translated into proper, natural-sounding English, regardless of its original language or content.
  - The resulting English text is the final value.
  - Keep Title Case flavors like "Pink Grapefruit".

 - flavor (string):
  - Step 1: Choose the Best Flavor Source: Your goal is to find the best representation of the product's taste.
    The primary source is the English flavor_description you just created. Attempt to extract specific tastes from it. If multiple tastes are found, combine them with an hyphen '-' (e.g., "coconut" and "blueberry" becomes "Coconut-Blueberry"). Only given "Woodruff & Pink Grapefruit" must remain with an ampersand "&"
    The secondary source is the flavour field from the input data translated into English. Remove duplicated Words, for example "Tropical-Tropical Fruits" -> "Tropical-Fruits"
    Decision Logic: Prefer the original flavor, but use the extracting flavour_description field if it provides a more concise or accurate summary - BUT do not strip down the original original flavor !. For example, prefer "Iced Vanilla Berry" (from flavour field) over a longer list like "Blueberry & Vanilla & Eucalyptus" (from description) or keep "Curuba-Elderflower" instead of only "Curuba".
  - Step 2: Fallback for No Flavor: If NO specific taste can be found in EITHER the flavor_description OR the original flavour field (e.g., text is generic), use the original flavour field's value as the base (e.g., "Energy Drink").
  - Step 3: Mandatory Cleaning and Formatting: Apply these cleaning rules to the flavor base determined in the previous steps:
    Remove the following keywords (case-insensitive): "Flavor", "Taste", "Flavour", "Sugarfree".
    Preserve compound flavor names (e.g., "Pink Grapefruit").
    Apply Title Case to the final string (e.g., "pink grapefruit" -> "Pink Grapefruit" or "dragon fruit" -> "Dragon Fruit" etc.).
  - Step 4: The flavor field MUST NOT contain "Flavour"

3. Final Output Structure & Cleanup:
- Each country object must contain a flag and a list of editions.
- Each product object in editions must contain id, name, flavor, flavor_description, and sugarfree.
- Flag Conversion Logic:
  - Country Codes: Convert standard codes to flag emojis (e.g., "US" -> üá∫üá∏, "DE" -> üá©üá™).
  - International: If flag is "Worldwide" and the root key is international, use the globe emoji üåç.
  - Regions: If flag is "Worldwide" and the root key is a region do NOT use üåç, use a suitable regional emoji ("caribbean" -> üå¥, "middle-east" -> üê™, etc.).
- Final Text Cleaning:
  - Before outputting, trim leading/trailing whitespace and remove special characters like * or # from all final string values.
  - **Mandatory Word Replacement:** In ALL final string values, especially within the `flavor_description`, you MUST replace every instance of the word "sugars" with "sugar". This is a non-negotiable final step.


RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response must be ONLY the final, clean JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanations, or Markdown formatting.
